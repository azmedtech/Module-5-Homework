# Module-5-Homework

Complete assignment in Jupyter Notebook, using Python code, making use of libraries including but not limited to: Pandas, MatPlotLib, SciPy, etc.

#Purpose:
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As the new senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

#Activity:
